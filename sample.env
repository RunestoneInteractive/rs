# Copy this file to .env docker-compose will read and use the values from here.
# The build.py script is also aware of this file and if you run `poetry self add
# poetry-dotenv-plugin` when you run `poetry shell` it will also pick up these
# variables and add them to your environment.  Note: once an environment variable is exported to
# your environment, modifying the value of that variable in the .env file will have no effect.
# You can use the ``unset`` command in bash or ``set -e`` in fish.

# This will ensure that the postgresql database defined in the docker-compose.yml file is started
# to run your own, comment out or change the line below. (see pgbouncer or nginx_dstart_dev)
# available profiles include:
#     basic - adds the db service to the composed app
#     production - adds pgbouncer
#     dev - adds the nginx_dstart_dev service
#     author -  adds the author and worker services
# multiple profiles can be enabled using a comma separated list e.g. basic,author
