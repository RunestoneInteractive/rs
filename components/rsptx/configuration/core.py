Configuring Runestone Servers
=============================

Many things about Runestone servers are configurable. This is the place to change
the configuration for most things.  **Private** things should be configured in the
environment so they are not accidentally committed to Github.
Defaults provided here may be overridden by environment variables `Per <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/settings/>`_.

# Imports

# These are listed in the order prescribed by `PEP 8`_.

from functools import lru_cache
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Local application imports

    Pydantic provides a wonderful utility to handle settings.  The beauty of it
    is that you can specify variables with or without default values, and Pydantic
    will check your environment variables in a case-insensitive way. So that
    if you have ``PROD_DBURL``` set in the environment it will be set as the value
    for ``prod_dburl``` in settings.
    This is a really nice way to keep from
    committing any data you want to keep private.
