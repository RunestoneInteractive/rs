# This sets up nginx to run both the old and new server together. It requires `processing by Python <Set up nginx based on env vars.>`\_ before use.

# This file was partially taken from the `gunicorn deployment docs <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html#nginx-configuration>`\_.

#

# `gzip_static <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html>`\_: Enables ("on") or disables ("off") checking the existence of precompressed files. Send compressed files in lieu of uncompressed files where they exist. This requires the optional `ngx_http_gzip_static_module` module.

    # `location <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location>`_: set configuration depending on a request URI. The ``~*`` indicates the following parameter is a case-insensitive regex. Look for web2py static files.
    #
    # Match web2py static paths with the application specified, such as ``/runestone/static/``. Avoid matching ``admin/`` so the admin interface works -- it uses the `web2py's static asset management <http://www.web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/04/the-core#Static-asset-management>`_ which breaks the simple redirect below.

Quoting the docs: "If the ``proxy_pass`` directive is specified with a URI, then when a request is passed to the server, the part of a normalized request URI matching the location is replaced by a URI specified in the directive."
