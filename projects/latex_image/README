This image is used by the author and worker services, so we can avoid the long build time 
introduced by creating a latex image.

To build this image simply run:

docker build . -t latex_base:important --label keep=true

When pruning

docker image prune -a --filter "label!=keep"
docker container prune

It might be --filter "label=keep=true"
