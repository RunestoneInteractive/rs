Bases
=====

Bases define the API for a server that a user will interact with. Including things like routes to web pages and API endpoints.

Components
==========

Components are shared pieces of code that can be used by multiple bases.  They are not meant to be used directly by a user.  They are meant to be used by a base to provide functionality to a user.

   cl_utils
   configuration
   db
   logging
   response_helpers
   templates
   validation

More to come.  The API documentation is a work in progress.
