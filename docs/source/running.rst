Running a Runestone Server
==========================

Maybe you just want to run your own server for a small course. Maybe you are an author who just wants to preview what your book will look like in Runestone.  (Hint:  Its going to look very much like the plain html, unless you have Java, C or C++ code) Or maybe you are interested in getting involved in the development of the Runestone tools, but want to experiement first.  This document will help you get started without having to install a lot of software on your own machine, or having to worry about setting up a web server or database or any development environment.  This assumes that you are using some kind of linux machine.  If you are using a modern apple silicon based mac, then you will need to build the images locally until I figure out how to publish both arm and x86 images to docker hub.

The Runestone server uses docker compose to start up a number of containers that work together to provide the Runestone environment.  Here are the steps to get started:

#. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.  You can find instructions for your operating system here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/  If you already have docker installed you can skip this step. but make sure that ``docker compose version`` tells you that you are running 2.20.2 or later. The current version is 2.27.1

#. Clone the Runestone repository to your local machine.  You can do this by running the following command: ``git clone https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/rs.git``

#. Change to the rs directory: ``cd rs``

#. copy the sample.env file to .env: ``cp sample.env .env``  At a minimum you will then need to edit ``.env`` to provide a value for ``BOOK_PATH``

#. Run the command ``docker compose pull`` this will pull the prebuilt images for the runestone services from our public docker hub repository.  This will take a while the first time you run it, but subsequent runs will be faster.

#. Start the database server by running the following command: ``docker compose up -d db``

#. Initialize the database by running the following command: ``docker compose run rsmanage rsmanage initdb``

#. Start the Runestone server by running the following command: ``docker compose up -d``

#. You should now be able to access the Runestone server by going to http://localhost in your web browser.  You can log in with the username ``testuser1`` and the password ``xxx``.

#. Now add a book. ``cd /your/path/to/book`` (the same value you used for ``BOOK_PATH``) and clone a book.  For example: ``git clone https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/overview.git``

#. Add the book to the database.  (Note this is not needed for overview since we preload many books) ``docker compose run rsmanage rsmanage addcourse`` You will then be prompted to enter some information about the course:

    .. code-block:: text

        Database connection successful
        Course Name: foo
        Base Course: foo
        Your institution: Runestone
        Require users to log in [Y/n]: n
        Enable pair programming support [y/N]: n

    If the course already exists in the database, it will ask you if you want to use a different name.

#. Now go back to the rs directory and run the following command: ``docker compose run rsmanage rsmanage build overview``  Insert your courses name in place of overview.  If you are building a PreTeXt book you will need to run ``docker compose run rsmanage rsmanage build --ptx yourbook``

#. You should now be able to access the overview book on your server running on localhost.  The url to go directly to your book is is `http://localhost/ns/books/published/yourbook/index.html``

If you want to stop the server, you can run the following command: ``docker compose stop``

Almost all of this could be scripted, and it would be an awesome idea for a PR if someone wanted to create a little script that would do all of this for you.  If you are interested in doing that, please let us know and we can help you get started.
