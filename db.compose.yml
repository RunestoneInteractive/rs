# this file can be used in conjunction with docker-compose.yml and author.compose.yml to
# add a database server in the same docker-compose network as the other runestone components
# this file is not used by default, but can be used by running 
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f db.compose.yml up -d

# It may also be easier in some circumstances to just copy the db service from this file to
# the docker-compose.yml file.  Taking note to add db as a link for each of the other services
# The db service should be started before the other services, so that the database is available

# For first time initialization I recommend you do
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f db.compose.yml up -d db
# this will start only the database server.
# Then you can run rsmanage initdb to create the database and tables and some initial population of the tables

# If you need the author server, find the lines that define the author and worker services below.
# They are marked with a comment that includes AUTHORSERVER. Uncomment the lines.
# -f author.compose.yml from the command line:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f author.compose.yml -f db.compose.yml up -d
