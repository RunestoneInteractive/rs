**Please check the current issues** Many bug reports are duplicates, this just creates more work for us. Searching the issues first may give you your answer or a workaround! If not adding new information to an existing report is much more helpful than a new report.

**What Page were you on**
Please copy/paste the URL from your address bar.

**What is your username**

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what what you were trying to accomplish and what went wrong. Vague statements like X does not work are not helpful.

**A Screenshot is worth a thousand words**
A video of you reproducing the problem is worth even more.

**Javascript Errors**
Many many errors can be quickly diagnosed from the Javascript Console error log. On Chrome this is View --> Developer --> Javascript Console, on Safari ⌥⌘i or Develop --> Show Web Inspector on Firefox Tools --> Web Developer --> Toggle Tools.  Please select **all** and paste it here.  Don't try to guess what might be useful.
