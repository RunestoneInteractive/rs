# |docname| - Provide a scalable synchronous chat system
# ******************************************************
# For effective peer instructio in a mixed or online class we must support some
# kind of chat system.  This may spill over into other use cases but for now the
# peer instruction pages are the main use case.  To provide a near real time chat
# environment we need to use websockets.  This is a new area for us in summer 2021
# creating a websocket chat system is super simple for a toy environment. One server
# process can track all users and their connections, but in a production environment
# with multiple workers it gets much more complicated.  `this article <https://tsh.io/blog/how-to-scale-websocket/>`_
# does a nice job of explaining the issues and solutions.
#
# Our architecture is as follows:
# We will use redis pubsub model to support a fast production environment.
#
# We have one end point called ``websocket_endpoint`` that browsers open a websocket with
# this connection is only for the page to RECEIVE messages.  The endpoint is also a redis
# subscriber to the "peermessages" channel.
#
# We have a second endpoint called ``send_message`` that accepts a json formatted message
# package.  This could be a broadcast text message, or could be a special control mesage
# that allows the instructor to move the students through the peer process.  The ``send_message``
# endpoint is the redis producer.
#
# The producer sends the message into the redis queue and then all copies of the consumer
# look at the message.  If the recipient of that message is connected to that instance
# then the message is sent to the recipient and all other instance ignore that message.
# If the message is a broadcast message then all instances of the consumer forward that
# message to all connected parties.
