/**
 *
 * @fileoverview This file contains the Redux slice for the assignment builder.
 * This is a good place to start if you are looking to understand how the assignment builder
 * interacts with the server.
 *
 * To see the major data, jump to the `assignSlice` object.
 *
 * The first part of this file defines a number of "thunks" which are async functions that can be dispatched
 * to the Redux store. These thunks are used to interact with the server. for example:
 * - `fetchAssignments` is used to get the list of assignments from the server
 * - `createAssignment` is used to create a new assignment on the server
 * - `fetchAssignmentQuestions` is used to get the list of questions associated with an assignment
 * - `sendExercise` is used to add a question to an assignment
 * - `sendDeleteExercises` is used to remove questions from an assignment
 * - `reorderAssignmentQuestions` is used to reorder the questions in an assignment
 * - `sendAssignmentUpdate` is used to update the assignment details
 * - `searchForQuestions` is used to search for questions in the question bank
