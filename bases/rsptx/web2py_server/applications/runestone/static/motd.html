    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.  Ensuring that every student has access to the textbook on day one is
    so important to student success.  So far this Fall we have done that for more
    than 44,000 students, in more than 2000 courses, from high school through graduate school.
