    Welcome to Summer 2024!  Did you know that in 2023/24 school year over 80,000 students registered on Runestone Academy?
    At $150 a textbook we saved students over $12 million! Thats
    a lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up
    and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please
    consider <a href="/runestone/default/donate">Becoming a member of Runestone Academy</a>
    or ask your institution to join. If every school joined us at $100 per class we would be
    fully sustainable and could add support staff and do more development.  Members get their school
    logo on the new course home page! <a href="/assignment/instructor/invoice_request">Request an Invoice</a>

    already.
