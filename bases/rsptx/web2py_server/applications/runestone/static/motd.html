    Welcome to the 2023/24 School year!  Did you know that over 75,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the 2022/2023 school year?
    At $150 a textbook we saved students over $11 million! Thats
    a lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up
    and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please
    consider <a href="/runestone/default/donate">Becoming a member of Runestone Academy</a> 
    or ask your institution to join. If every school joined us at $100 per class we would be 
    fully sustainable and could add support staff and do more development.  Members get their school
    logo on the new course home page!

<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
